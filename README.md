Gym Management Application

This is a **Spring Boot project** I built to practice backend development and learn how real-world applications are structured.  
It‚Äôs a REST API for managing a gym ‚Äî with users, trainers, managers, memberships, and gym classes.

## üí° What It Does

- Create, read, update, and delete gym classes, users, trainers, managers, and memberships;  
- Uses DTOs and Mappers (MapStruct) to keep data clean between layers;
- Has services, repositories, and controllers for each entity;  
- Includes Swagger for documentation;  
- Tested with **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**

Tech-Stack

- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- Spring Data JPA  
- MapStruct  
- Maven  
- Lombok  
- JUnit 5 & Mockito  
- Swagger (OpenAPI 3)

2. Build it with Maven:

Run it
mvn spring-boot:run

3. Open your browser and go to:

 Testing my Application
 
All services and controllers have unit tests.
Tests use Mockito to mock dependencies and JUnit 5 to verify behavior.

Each test class has a setup method that runs before every test.

Example naming style:
methodName_ShouldDoSomething_WhenCondition()
